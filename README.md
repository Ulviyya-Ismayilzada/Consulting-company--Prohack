In this task, we need to predict the target value (“y”) given all the other features.
The task is composed of two components in the project:
Prediction (Regression)
Optimization
We have already worked on the dataset within data cleaning and preprocessing. All missing values have been handled by either imputing or dropping them. Then, we analyzed the dataset using visualization libraries. Through feature engineering and feature selection, we identified the best features for prediction. Since we need continuous values, regression modeling was implemented. We evaluated the model performance and then predicted the target on the new test data.
